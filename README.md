# Reinforcement Learning in Hockey Environment

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **Reinforcement Learning in Hockey Environment** project presented in the "Reinforcement Learning" lecture at the University of Tuebingen. In this project, we explored and implemented three distinct reinforcement learning algorithms to tackle the "Hockey" environment—a simple game where two agents engage in an air hockey-like match.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project was to demonstrate the effectiveness of various reinforcement learning algorithms in solving the "Hockey" environment. Our group members each implemented a different algorithm, detailing their methods, modifications, and experiment results to identify optimal hyperparameters. The implemented algorithms are:

1. **DQN (Deep Q-Network) - Leonard Franz**
2. **Soft Actor Critic - Yun Kuan Su**
3. **Twin Delayed DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients) - Janik Steegmüller**

## Environment Description

The "Hockey" environment consists of a simulated air hockey-like game where two agents compete against each other. The agents aim to learn strategies and actions that result in winning the game. The project primarily focuses on training agents to perform well against an easy opponent within this environment.
